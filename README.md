Modern S3 Browser with AWS JS SDK

## What it does ##

This is a chrome extention to access and upload AWS S3 files.

### Why we need one more S3 file access plugin ###

MyS3Browser uses AWS JS SDK, This should keep this compatible with all the latest changes AWS S3 has done. It should remain compatible as long as AWS is maintaining their JS SDK.
